# NextJS + Firebase 9 - Sign in and private/public pages

This is a suggestion of a NextJS working with Firebase 9.0.1 (new modular web SDK).
This project has a login system (Email and Password) working and has a particular approach to manage access to public or private pages.

Hope this help you in your next project!

You feedback is always welcome!

Happy coding!
